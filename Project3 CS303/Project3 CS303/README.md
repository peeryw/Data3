UMKC CS 303 Project

This program will read in a text file and convert it to a binary tree
of the depth of 4. It is used to translate morse code from letter
to code and code to letter. It only translates one word at a time.
It uses maps to make the translation easier. Dots on the tree always
travers left and dashes (underscores) always travers right.

This project was for summer class CS 303 at UMKC.

The group members and contributers are as follows in alphbetical order:
Joshua Ford
Jack Goza
Scott Peery

This code is opensource. If you use it or any part of it, please give
